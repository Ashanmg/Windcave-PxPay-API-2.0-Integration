What is PxPay 2.0?
"PxPay 2.0 is a platform-independent e-commerce solution provided by Windcave. Using a Hosted Payment Page to accept sensitive card data, PxPay2.0 provides a financially secure and compliant solution without exposing merchants to sensitive information. Instead of hosting a payment page on their own website, PxPay 2.0 allows merchants to redirect their customers to a payment page hosted by Windcave; this will normally reduce the scope of Payment Card Industry compliance."
Since the e-commerce application handover, the responsibility of the customer's payment you don't worry about and application decoupled with transactions.
